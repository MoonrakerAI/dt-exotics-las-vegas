# Notification System Fixes - Complete Guide

## 🔍 Issues Identified and Fixed

### **Issue 1: Missing Notification Settings in Critical APIs** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: The notification system stores settings in Vercel KV (`notification_settings`), but most API endpoints weren't loading these settings before sending emails. This caused emails to be blocked by default settings.

**Affected Endpoints**:
- ❌ `/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts` - Stripe payment webhooks
- ❌ `/api/rentals/create-deposit-intent/route.ts` - Booking creation
- ❌ `/api/admin/reminders/send/route.ts` - Automated reminders

**Fix Applied**: Added settings loading at the start of each endpoint:
```typescript
// Load notification settings from KV store
const savedSettings = await kv.get('notification_settings');
if (savedSettings) {
  notificationService.updateSettings(savedSettings as any);
  console.log('[ENDPOINT] Notification settings loaded');
} else {
  console.log('[ENDPOINT] No saved notification settings found, using defaults');
}
```

### **Issue 2: Silent Failures with Poor Logging** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Email failures were logged with minimal information, making debugging difficult.

**Fix Applied**: Enhanced logging throughout the notification system with clear emoji indicators:
- 📧 Email sending attempts
- ✅ Successful sends
- ❌ Failed sends with detailed error messages
- 🔔 Notification method calls
- ⚠️ Settings blocking notifications

### **Issue 3: No Diagnostic Tools** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: No way to quickly check notification system health and configuration.

**Fix Applied**: Created comprehensive diagnostic endpoint at `/api/admin/notifications/diagnose`

## 🚀 How to Use the Diagnostic Endpoint

### **Quick Health Check**
```bash
curl https://your-domain.com/api/admin/notifications/diagnose
```

Or visit in browser:
```
https://your-domain.com/api/admin/notifications/diagnose
```

### **What It Checks**
1. ✅ RESEND_API_KEY configuration
2. ✅ Notification settings from KV store
3. ✅ Email notifications master switch
4. ✅ Individual alert types (booking, payment, system)
5. ✅ Admin email configuration
6. ✅ All API endpoints that send notifications

### **Sample Output**
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
  "status": "ALL CHECKS PASSED",
  "environment": {
    "RESEND_API_KEY": "✅ Configured",
    "NODE_ENV": "production"
  },
  "currentSettings": {
    "emailNotifications": true,
    "bookingAlerts": true,
    "paymentAlerts": true,
    "systemAlerts": true,
    "adminEmails": ["admin@dtexoticslv.com"]
  },
  "checks": [
    {
      "name": "Email Notifications Master Switch",
      "enabled": true,
      "status": "✅ Enabled"
    },
    {
      "name": "Booking Alerts",
      "enabled": true,
      "status": "✅ Enabled"
    }
  ],

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Guide

### **Problem: No Emails Being Sent**

**Step 1: Run Diagnostics**
```bash
curl https://your-domain.com/api/admin/notifications/diagnose
```

**Step 2: Check for Critical Issues**
Look for issues marked with ❌:
- Missing RESEND_API_KEY
- Email notifications disabled
- No admin emails configured

**Step 3: Fix Critical Issues**

#### Missing RESEND_API_KEY
1. Get API key from [Resend Dashboard](https://resend.com/api-keys)
2. Add to environment variables:
   ```bash
   # In Vercel Dashboard
   RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_api_key_here
   ```
3. Redeploy application

#### Email Notifications Disabled
1. Go to `/admin/notifications`
2. Toggle "Email Notifications" to ON
3. Save settings

#### No Admin Emails
1. Go to `/admin/notifications`
2. Add admin email addresses
3. Save settings

### **Problem: Some Emails Work, Others Don't**

**Check Specific Alert Types**:
1. Run diagnostics endpoint
2. Look at `checks` array for disabled alerts
3. Enable specific alert types in `/admin/notifications`:
   - Booking Alerts → Booking confirmations
   - Payment Alerts → Payment success/failure
   - System Alerts → System errors

### **Problem: Emails to Customers Not Sent**

**Customer emails don't check settings** - they should always send. If they're not:
1. Check RESEND_API_KEY is configured
2. Check server logs for error messages
3. Look for `❌ [NOTIFICATION]` errors in logs

## 🎯 Testing Notifications

### **Test Individual Notification Types**
Use the existing test endpoint:
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/admin/notifications/test \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "booking",
    "targetEmail": "test@example.com"
  }'
```

**Available Types**:
- `booking` - Admin booking notification
- `payment_success` - Admin payment success
- `payment_failed` - Admin payment failure
- `customer_booking` - Customer booking confirmation
- `customer_payment_success` - Customer payment receipt
- `customer_payment_failed` - Customer payment failed
- `customer_reminder` - Customer rental reminder
- `system` - System alert

### **Test Automated Reminders**
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/admin/reminders/send
```

## 📝 Enhanced Logging Guide

### **Log Patterns to Watch**

#### Successful Email Send
```
📧 [NOTIFICATION] Attempting to send email...
📧 [NOTIFICATION] To: customer@example.com
📧 [NOTIFICATION] Subject: Booking Confirmed
✅ [NOTIFICATION] Email sent successfully!
```

#### Blocked by Settings
```
🔔 [NOTIFICATION] sendBookingNotification called
⚠️ [NOTIFICATION] Booking notification BLOCKED by settings
⚠️ [NOTIFICATION] emailNotifications: false
```

#### Missing API Key
```
❌ [NOTIFICATION] Resend not configured - missing RESEND_API_KEY
❌ [NOTIFICATION] Email NOT sent to: customer@example.com
```

#### Send Failure
```
📧 [NOTIFICATION] Attempting to send email...
❌ [NOTIFICATION] Failed to send email to: customer@example.com
❌ [NOTIFICATION] Error details: Invalid API key
```

## 🔐 Security Notes

1. **Admin Endpoint**: `/api/admin/notifications/diagnose` should be protected by admin authentication in production
2. **Sensitive Data**: Diagnostic output includes settings but NOT the actual RESEND_API_KEY value
3. **Log Monitoring**: Enhanced logs may contain customer emails - ensure log retention policies comply with privacy regulations
